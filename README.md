This project was somewhat a CPD project on UI and UX, so under this is a description on what i learnt, my reflections of the project and how to use the website.
# 1. Motivation
As a software engineer, I want to focus on humanitarian issues. An important part of this is to make sure all capabilities can use the software. As a result, I want to learn how to develop a user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) that is accessible to all people, regardless of their capabilities. I aim to create software that meets the needs of diverse users and provides a positive experience for everyone. This falls under various headings in the SWEBOK (Software Engineering Body of Knowledge), such as software requirements, where you consider what the user experience will require from the application.
I also chose to do this because I believe my previous webpage UI and UX that I made in the web technology unit was not good at all. It had a poor colour choice, it was hard to see and very messy. As I was more focused on learning how to build the website instead of designing how it looked or felt to the user. But I feel this is an important skill to have as software engineering is not just the backend but the frontend as well.
Learning Outcomes
•	Construct applications with good UX and UI for the specific users it’s made for
•	Defend and argue why I made certain UX and UI designs.
•	Be able to describe UX and UI design choices.
•	Memorize important facts about UX and UI
# 2. What I planned
To achieve learning outcomes, I set out a plan to learn while developing a web application with a user-friendly interface and intuitive user experience for project managers seeking easy project management. Focus on creating a visually appealing webpage that will hold a Gantt chart for managers and teams to look at tasks.
Where I’m learning from
I did a course on LinkedIn Learning and watched videos on YouTube

# 3. Learning

This section will go over what I learned and how I integrated that into the project I made.

# 3.1 Users Stories

I learned when making a UX for users, it’s important to realise that different users will use your webpage in different ways. So, it’s important to get in the head of the different users and write out what things they would want on the webpage to cater to them. I did this by writing user stories from different types of people who would use my web application.
•	As a manager I would want to be able to check my team’s tasks at night-time so I know what we are doing the next day
•	As a vision impaired team member, I would like to be able to clearly see the tasks I have to do and by when without having to strain my eyes
•	As a colour-blind person team member, I don’t want to be confused with the tasks or the layout to be clear to me, as I don’t want to make any mistakes
•	As a manager, I want to remove tasks from the Gannt chart, if they are no longer needed so my team doesn’t do them
•	As a manager, I want to be able to add tasks so my team can see when certain tasks are to be done
•	As a manager, if the project starts earlier or delays, I want the chart to make adjustments to still show those tasks
# 3.2 Design
I learned it’s important to have a simple design that won’t confuse users. As we want the users to not get frustrated and lost, as if they do, they may exit the page and go to another website. Especially we have to consider that many ages could be using this site and older users may get confused if they get put on a page just to add a task.

So, my goal was to create a design that was simple and to fit onto one page. As a result, I decided to make it so that sections would appear instead of going to another page.

# 3.3 Colour
Making sure everything on your screen is readable to everyone is important. So, I learned how important it is to choose colours. As some colours don’t work with others. For example, red text is not going to be readable on white background as the contrast is not good between those colours, so users will find the text hard to read.

People with colour blindness may only be able to see some colour or see in greyscale (black, white, and shades of grey).  

So that is why I used a contrast checker online to see if the colours for the page that I used worked. I also made sure to look at what the colours looked like in greyscale to make sure they were visible for colour-blind people. I did have to play around with the colours for my site a bit until I got everything right and everyone would be able to see the elements of the webpage.

# 3.4 Environments and flexibility
I’ve also learned about how people are going to be in different environments when they are using your webpage and use your webpage in a different way than expected. So, it’s necessary to think about how and where people will use the webpage.

Well, I thought that people could use my webpage at night-time, so I decided to add a “Dark Mode” as bright colours during the night could strain the user’s eyes and make elements more unreadable. So, changing the mode that gives darker colours to the webpage, would give users the ability to read easier at night time.

I also thought to make the webpage more flexible, as people could use it in a way I didn’t expect. Even though my expectation would be for people to have tasks this year that they are in, I decided to make it flexible by allowing the Gantt chart to change the dates at the bottom if a person put a date before or after the current year.
# 3.5 Accessibility 
Having settings for disabled people is so important. Being legally blind I always knew this as I often find it hard to see very small elements on my screen, but it was nice learning ways to implement it into the website for others like me. 

On my webpage, I included text size functionality so that people who can’t see the text on the Gannt chart could enlarge and decrease the text if needed. 

I learned that it’s important to help users know where they are looking so they are not confused.

I decided to make the Gantt chart tasks alternate colours, so the user wouldn’t get confused about which task they are looking at. If all the tasks were one colour, the user’s eyes could accidentally look at the wrong line.

A UI technique I learnt was to put a different colour on any element the user is hovering or focusing on. This would allow the user to know where they are and what they are doing.

# 4. Results
To see if I completed my learning outcomes, I showed 10 of my friends the webpage and let them play around with it. I gave them a survey to rate their thoughts on the UI and UX out of 5.
 
As you can see a rating of 4 was voted the most, so I believe that I did achieve my goals as I can see that people do like the UI and UX of the webpage.

# 5. Reflection
I had fun making this project. I feel like I learned a lot about making good UI and UX decisions. I believe that I satisfied my learning outcomes and created a webpage that satisfies all the user stories I created. 

If I did it again, I wish I used more time for developing the webpage further to add more and show off more UI and UX skills. I would also like of to do a better survey, such as from people who weren’t my friends to gain fairer data, more written feedback than just a rating, and see if there was a difference in rating between the UI and UX.

It was great learning about the importance of UI and UX on a web page. As it helps users stay on the page and keeps the owners of the webpage keep good brand recognition. I enjoyed learning the different UI and UX skills but also getting more practice in my website-building skills.

# 6. My CPD Project
This section will go over the product that I created using what I learned.

When tasks appear on the Gantt chart they will be in alternating red and blue colours.

If a date is before 2023 or after 2023 the Gantt Chart will update to suit those tasks.

# Switch Light Mode
If you press the “Switch Light Mode”, it will switch the colours of the webpage to the other light mode. “Dark mode” has darker colours used, helpful when used during the night. “Bright mode” is the initial webpage look, uses a lot brighter colours. 

Here is what the dark mode looks like:
